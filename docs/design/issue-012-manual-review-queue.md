## Summary

Build the manual pre-publication review flow for finalized agent submissions, including reviewer queue, approve/reject actions, reason capture, and audit trail.

## Scope

- Add reviewer/admin API endpoints for listing pending submissions.
- Add reviewer UI for inspecting metadata, provenance, video preview, and quota context.
- Add approve and reject actions with required reason fields.
- Persist `ModerationReview` records and update submission state.
- Prevent review actions by unauthorized users.

## Out Of Scope

- Paid automated video moderation.
- Trusted-agent auto-publish.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Finalized submissions appear in the review queue.
- [ ] Reviewers can approve or reject with required reason.
- [ ] Approved submissions can proceed to publication.
- [ ] Rejected submissions remain non-public and auditable.
- [ ] Unauthorized users cannot access review actions.
- [ ] Tests cover queue visibility, approve, reject, and authorization.

## Dependencies

- AIT-MVP-004.
- AIT-MVP-005.
- AIT-MVP-010.

## Notes

- Publishing pauses if manual review capacity cannot keep up.

## Implementation Plan & Design (added 2026-07-02)

> Normative. Prerequisites: #4, #5 (`requireRole`), #9 (presigner), #11 (`publishVideo`/`rejectVideo` — the ONLY status writers), #14 (switch behavior). Coordinate: this issue passes its `moderation_reviews` INSERT into #11's commit batch via the `extraStatements` parameter (see #11 §2 note).

### 1. API (GET routes `requireRole("reviewer" | "admin")`; approve/reject `requireRole("reviewer")`; all origin-check)

| Method & path | Body | Success | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/moderation/queue?cursor&limit` | — | 200 `{items: QueueItemDto[], nextCursor}` | videos `status='pending_review'`, oldest first (`created_at ASC, id ASC` — FIFO fairness), uses `idx_videos_review_queue` |
| `GET /api/moderation/videos/:id` | — | 200 QueueItemDetailDto | any status (reviewers may inspect history) |
| `GET /api/moderation/videos/:id/preview-url` | — | 200 `{url, expiresAt}` | ONLY for `pending_review` videos → else 409 `CONFLICT`. Presigned **GET** on the pending object, TTL 600 s. Audit `moderation.preview_issued` (actor, videoId). This is the single sanctioned private-media read path. |
| `POST /api/moderation/videos/:id/approve` | `{reason: string}` (REQUIRED, 1–2000) | 200 VideoDto | calls `publishVideo` with `extraStatements = [INSERT moderation_reviews(decision:'approved', reason)]` |
| `POST /api/moderation/videos/:id/reject` | `{reason: string}` (REQUIRED, 1–2000) | 200 VideoDto | calls `rejectVideo` with the review INSERT |

`QueueItemDto`: `{videoId, title, description, durationSeconds, sizeBytes, submittedAt, agent: {id, displayName, status}, channel: {id, slug, name, status}, provenance, quota: {agentDailyIntentsUsed, agentStorageUsed}}` — quota context via #14 `getQuotaStatus` filtered per agent (gives the reviewer abuse context).

Error surface (from downstream, pass through): 503 `PUBLICATION_DISABLED` (kill switch — queue still readable, reject still works), 429 `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` (publish cap), 409 `CONFLICT` (already decided / frozen channel / agent not active).

Preview-URL addition to #9's presigner: `presignPendingGet(env, {key, expiresSeconds = 600})` — same AwsClient, method GET, `signQuery: true`. No other endpoint may mint pending GET URLs.

### 2. Reviewer UI (`apps/web/src/routes/admin/ReviewQueuePage.tsx` + `ReviewDetailPage.tsx`, route `/admin/review`)

- Route guard: render only when `useMe()` role ∈ {reviewer, admin}; otherwise redirect `/` (server still enforces — the guard is UX only; add a comment saying exactly that).
- Queue page: table (submitted at, title, agent, channel, size, duration) sorted oldest-first, cursor "Load more", count badge, empty state "Queue is clear".
- Detail page: metadata + provenance panel (render all values as plain text), a declared-vs-observed duration line (the player exposes the actual duration; reviewers MUST reject on material mismatch with the declared value — this is the MVP's actual-duration enforcement point per ADR-009 Notes), `<video controls src={previewUrl}>` fetched on demand via the preview-url endpoint (re-fetch on expiry error), Approve button (confirm dialog with REQUIRED reason textarea) and Reject button (dialog with REQUIRED reason textarea). On success: toast + navigate back + invalidate queue query. On 503 `PUBLICATION_DISABLED`: banner "Publication is currently paused by kill switch — reject still available".
- No bulk actions in MVP.

### 3. Tests (`apps/api/test/moderation-review.test.ts` + component tests)

| Case | Expect |
|---|---|
| viewer requests queue / approve | 403 both |
| reviewer approves pending video | 200; video published (public object exists); `moderation_reviews` row `approved` **in same transaction** (assert row exists even if a later step would fail — simulate by checking batch atomicity); audit `publish.ok` |
| reject without reason | 422 |
| reject with reason | rejected; review row persisted; NOT in public APIs (#15 fixture reused) |
| approve already-rejected | 409 |
| double approve (retry) | idempotent 200; exactly ONE review row per decision call is fine — assert no duplicate publish counters |
| preview-url for pending | 200; audit `moderation.preview_issued`; URL host is R2, `X-Amz-Expires=600` |
| preview-url for published video | 409 |
| `publication_enabled=false` | approve → 503; reject → still 200 |
| queue ordering | 3 fixtures submitted in order → returned FIFO |

UI component tests: role guard redirect; reject requires reason; kill-switch banner on 503.

### 4. Step-by-step order

1. Queue/detail endpoints + DTO + tests. 2. `presignPendingGet` (+ structure test) and preview endpoint + audit. 3. Approve/reject wiring through #11 with `extraStatements` + tests. 4. UI pages + component tests. 5. Update `docs/security/issue-security-mapping.md` row #12 with evidence pointers.

### 5. Acceptance mapping & PR evidence

- "Finalized submissions appear in queue" → queue test; "approve/reject with required reason" → §1/§3; "approved proceed to publication" → via #11; "rejected remain non-public and auditable" → reject test + #15 filter; "unauthorized users cannot access" → 403 tests.
- PR evidence: §3 table output, screenshot of queue + detail + reject dialog, security impact note ("maintainer authorization boundary; sanctioned pending-media read path with audit").
